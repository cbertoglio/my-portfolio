Tools I used: 
What tools did you use in completing this project? 
To complete this project, I went to file in email. From there I went to settings, and searched for signatures. Then, following the directions within the signatures tab, I set up a signature for my school email.

Challenges I faced:
What challenges did you face, and how? What obstacles did you overcome? 
One challenge I faced was figuring out how to add the signature to the replys and forwards. I eventually found it by scrolling down below the section for creating a new email, and I added it by clicking within the "For replys and forwards" section and selecting the signature I had just made.
